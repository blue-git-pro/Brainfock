Changelog
=========

Summary of changes in Brainfock project code. Changelog entries usually are split into `Features`, `Fixes` and `Style tweaks` sections.
When makes sense, items in these section may be subdivided by application component (e.g. `Server`, `API`, `iOS Client`).

## 13 Oct Sept 2015; Sergii Gamaiunov <hello@webkadabra.com> v0.19.0:

### Features

##### API
* Add new topic REST API endpoint `api/topics/:contextTopicKey/formFields`

  Load fields for topic `create` form screen. Available fields are based on topic type, group and group parent (if any), effective screen scheme (currently supports default scheme), and screen configuration (screen_fields in configured order). Currently, only system fields are available, but custom fields are in TODO.


* Find topics by their contextTopicKey, eg. /api/topics/BF
* REST API `GET topics/count` (filters supported via `?where[prop]=value`)
* Allow to access related topic of a topic (`api/topics/someTopic123/topics`), respecting access control (find & count methods)

##### Server
* Introduce `Workspaces` back into Brainfock. Workspaces have namespace, owner and permission settings just like any other topic
* Improve server rendering: fetch data based on components' `resolveData`` method (implemented for `Wiki` pages)
* Extend `Topics` database table view to include `wfStage` & `wfStatus` values
* Populate `Entity` for `Topic` on creation
* Production-ready datasources config (ENV's must be set, see tech readme)
* Wiki: add guest read access, provide document title (SEO), improve page save & update (backend)
* API to load available filters for topics group
* Add lacking models (TopicsGroup, Schemes etc.)
* Store configuraiton fo topic group schemes & fields schemes in Database

##### Web client
* Project settings page
* Project issues page
* Add bower config
* Add Google Analytics to environment-friendly config
* Add simple form factory component to build basic forms' UIs (based on `api/topics/*/formFields` data)
* Add form for creating new topic (in project/issues)
* Wiki: recognize internal links and navigate with react-router on a client-side
* Simple form factory for generating forms based on props
* setup catching IO comments once per app

### Fixes

* Fix assets path for statics
